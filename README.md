# vue-weather
### Introduction
After learning from the resources, I Create a weather app using vue and fetching data from a Weather API.

Get current weather from a restful weather api and set weather background.
If the weather is sunny, then the background will be sunny picture, otherwise, the background will be cloud images.
I did a little optimization to directly show the current date(so this is app is not for forcasting, this is current time weather board :
let date = new Date();
return date; 

Key take away: how to use Vue Cli, and call API and Conditional rendering

## Project setup
